The game starts with the player character getting transported inside of a Victorious inspired show called Brillante Elisa. The main cast of characters is:

Elisa - the main character and a princess who was scouted at a young age to be a student at the school (a performing arts school; not named yet)

Sana - Elisa’s best friend and love interest who makes latin pop music.

Amanda - A superficial bubblegum popstar and the school’s mean girl.

Seth - A nerdy boy who doesn’t know how to read the room.

The player runs into Seth when going into the school, only to be weirded out and walk past him. Then, they happen to find Elisa and Sana, who take the player under their wing.

After the player is called to the principal’s office to receive their class schedule, they overhear the principal talking about his plan being set in motion to overthrow Elisa’s kingdom. His first part of the plan is capturing Elisa’s brother, which has already been done.

To get out of the show, the player needs to find and rescue Elisa’s brother so he can reunite with Elisa and work with her to rally their kingdom’s knights to be able to protect their kingdom from attack.

This is done by playing through the story and selecting choices that will eventually lead to the rescue of Elisa’s brother.
